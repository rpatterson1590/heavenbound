          <h3>Pastor Lee Kendrick</h3>
          <p>
            Pastor Lee Kendrick was raised in a home rooted in ministry and surrounded by the calling of God. While many recognized the anointing on his life, Lee wrestled with accepting the call to preach. However, through powerful encounters — including a life-changing mission trip to Peru and a word from the Lord through his mother, Pastor Debbie Kendrick — Lee eventually surrendered and answered the call.
          </p>
          <p>
            After faithfully serving as Pastor of Faith Baptist Church, Lee joined Heaven Bound Church of God in 2021 and officially became the Lead Pastor in February 2021. Since then, he has continued the legacy of faith, leadership, and service established by his parents while bringing fresh vision and passion to the church family.
          </p>

          <h3>Stevie Kendrick</h3>
          <p>
            Standing faithfully beside him is his wife Stevie — a woman of strength, grace, and unwavering support. Together, they serve the church with humility and a shared heart for the people of God. Their ministry reflects unity, love, and obedience to God's purpose for their family and the Heaven Bound congregation.
