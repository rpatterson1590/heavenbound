          <h3>Pastor Debbie Kendrick</h3>
          <p>
            Pastor Debbie Kendrick answered God’s call at 19 after a powerful and personal encounter with the Holy Spirit. Though initially reluctant, she surrendered to the call and began preaching full-time in 1977. In 1992, she founded Heaven Bound Church of God after hearing God clearly say, "Now Obey Me!" She has since faithfully ministered for over 48 years and continues to serve as Senior Pastor, leading with compassion, vision, and unwavering devotion.
          </p>

          <h3>Evangelist Harvey Kendrick</h3>
          <p>
            Harvey Kendrick, husband of Pastor Debbie, has faithfully stood beside her in ministry for decades. Together, they traveled as full-time evangelists across the U.S. for 3½ years, proclaiming the Gospel with boldness and grace. Harvey continues to serve as a steadfast leader, encourager, and spiritual mentor within the Heaven Bound Church of God family.
