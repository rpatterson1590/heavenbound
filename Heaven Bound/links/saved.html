    <h2>✝️ What Must I Do to Be Saved?</h2>
  
    <p>Salvation is the most important decision a person can make. The Bible tells us that eternal life is a free gift through Jesus Christ. But what must we do to receive it?</p>

    <h3>1. Recognize the Need for Salvation</h3>
    <p><strong>Romans 3:23</strong> — “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 6:23</strong> — “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</p>

    <h3>2. Believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ</h3>
    <p><strong>John 3:16</strong> — “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>
    <p><strong>Romans 10:9</strong> — “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”</p>

    <h3>3. Repent of Sin</h3>
    <p><strong>Acts 3:19</strong> — “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out...”</p>
    <p>To repent means to turn away from sin and turn to God — not just a feeling of regret, but a change of direction in your life.</p>

    <h3>4. Confess Jesus as Lord</h3>
    <p><strong>Romans 10:10</strong> — “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</p>
    <p>Speak your faith. A true believer is not ashamed to confess Jesus Christ publicly.</p>

    <h3>5. Be Baptized in Obedience</h3>
    <p><strong>Acts 2:38</strong> — “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
    <p>Water baptism is an outward symbol of an inward change — identifying with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. It is an act of obedience and surrender.</p>

    <h3>6. Receive the Holy Spirit and Walk in New Life</h3>
    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong> — “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</p>
    <p>God gives His Spirit to those who obey Him (<strong>Acts 5:32</strong>). Salvation is not just a moment — it’s the beginning of a new life in Christ. You now walk by faith, growing in grace, and living for His glory.</p>

    <h3>❤️ Ready to Respond?</h3>
    <p>Salvation is a gift — but you must receive it. You can respond to God's invitation today:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <em>“Lord Jesus, I know I’m a sinner. I believe You died for my sins and rose again. I turn from my sin and trust You as Lord and Savior. Take my life and make me new. In Jesus’ name, amen.”</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 6:2</strong> — “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.”</p>
